# @scarcitybot

**What is this?**

[@scarcitybot](http://twitter.com/scarcitybot) automatically keeps track of the URL for [@stfj's](https://github.com/stfj) [Scarcity](http://stfj.net/index2.php?year=2021&project=art/2021/Scarcity) and publishes it to Twitter. It will eventually publish the complete ledger as well. If you want to run your own copy without tweeting the results, just set `publish` to `False`.

**Requirements:**
 * Python 3 (I finally updated. Leave me alone.)
 * Twython

**How To Use:**
 * Clone this repo
 * Edit the settings in `keys.py.example`
 * Change `publish` to `False` in `scarcitybot.py` if you don't want it to tweet

**Thanks to [Zach Gage for making Scarcity](https://twitter.com/helvetica/status/1369033776945332226) (and [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/non-fungible-thursday) for bringing it to my attention), which inspired me to make a twitter bot for the first time in years.**
